Hello! Thanks for checking out Random Encounter. This was a project I worked on for
my senior year programming class in high school to demonstrate proficiency in Java. 
To play, run the RandomEncounterv1 executable and click 1 flame for single player and
2 flames for 2 player.

Controls:
P1: 
WASD to move up, left, down, right respectively
U to shoot a fireball

P2:
Arrow keys to move
NUM7 to shoot a fireball

The objective of the game is to walk through the doors randomly located in the four cardinal
locations of the screen. Red doors indicate areas "away" from your spawn location, and
blue doors lead you back to spawn, where there is a heart shaped health fountain that will
heal you by standing on it. The skull enemies chase the player within a certain range in 
one of 8 directions, and catch fire to damage the player once they get close. The spider enemies
do not damage the player directly, instead they maintain a certain distance and shoot
webs at the player to slow them. The player stops when they shoot, which causes the player to
consider their location when they start attacking enemies.
After exploring ten new rooms without dying, another health fountain and a single door will
appear, which leads to the final boss room. Defeating the boss wins the game for the player.

***2 PLAYER NOTE***
I implemented 2 players super quickly on the morning the project was due (because a friend
dared me to see if I could do it), so it works well for the most part. There is a random bug
that occurs semi frequently which crashes the game, it has something to do with a bullet 
attempting to be removed twice, but oh well, 2 players was just added to mess around
anyway :)
